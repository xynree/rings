# Rings


## About

A productivity tool for creating concentric circular graphs. This was created as a challenge to use Vanilla Javascript and Object-Oriented Programming principles in order to create a complex, interactive, UI based system. View the deployed version of this project [here](https://xynree.github.io/rings/).

## Usage

Drag rings out from the center circle to divide your ring into smaller sections. Double clicking anywhere inside your ring will create a text node that can be dragged around the circle and reorganized.  Multiple ring groups can be added, deleted and adjusted this way. Rings persist between browser sessions with local storage.

## Technologies Used

Written in Typescript + TailwindCSS. Implements drag and drop with native HTML Drag and Drop. Storage with Local Storage.
